## Preparing the Extension for Installation

Before installing the EasyWords extension on your Chrome browser, you need to prepare it by following these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   First, clone the EasyWords repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codedevbox/EasyWords.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and install the necessary dependencies using Yarn. Run:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Build the Extension:**
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can build the extension for production by running:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

This command compiles the extension and generates a dist directory containing the build artifacts.

After completing these steps, your EasyWords extension is ready to be installed in your Chrome browser.


## Installing the Extension Manually

If the EasyWords extension is not available in the Google Chrome Web Store, you can still install it manually using the Developer mode in Chrome. Follow these steps to install the extension directly from the `dist` folder:

1. **Open Chrome Extensions Page:**
   Launch Google Chrome and navigate to the Extensions page by entering `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.

2. **Enable Developer Mode:**
   Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner of the Extensions page to enable it.

3. **Load Unpacked Extension:**
   Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer mode. A file dialog will open.

4. **Select the `dist` Folder:**
   Navigate to the location of your EasyWords extension's `dist` folder (the folder created after building the extension with `yarn build`). Select the `dist` folder and click "Open" or "Select Folder" (depending on your operating system).

Chrome will now install the EasyWords extension directly from the selected folder. You should see the EasyWords extension icon appear in your Chrome toolbar, indicating that the installation was successful.

5. **Use the Extension:**
   Click on the EasyWords extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to start using it. You can now easily capture new words and phrases as you browse.

Remember, since this extension is installed manually, it will not automatically update. To update the extension, you will need to pull the latest changes from the repository, rebuild the extension, and then repeat the steps above to load the updated version.
